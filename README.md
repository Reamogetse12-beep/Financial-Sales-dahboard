## 📝 **Conclusion**

The East region emerged as the strongest performer, leading both revenue and profit metrics, suggesting strategic priorities should include maintaining momentum there while learning from its operational model.  
The West region appears stable yet underperforming compared to others, presenting an opportunity for targeted marketing, pricing adjustments, or product mix refinement.  
Performance across regions was largely balanced in terms of product counts, implying that revenue differences may be driven more by pricing strategy, demand behavior, or margin efficiency rather than sales volume alone.

Overall, the dashboard successfully enables business stakeholders to:
- Compare regional performance at a glance,
- Monitor revenue and profit trends over time, and
- Identify improvement opportunities that support data-driven decisions.
